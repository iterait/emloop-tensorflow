Welcome to cxflow-tensorflow docs
=================================

**cxflow-tensorflow** is a **cxflow** plugin that allows you to train TensorFlow models effortlessly.
Instead of having to write tens or hundreds of lines of code,
**cxflow-tensorflow** lets you focus on the model architecture.

However, before you start working with cxflow-tensorflow, make sure you have read

- `TensorFlow essentials <https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/>`_
- :doc:`cxflow basics <cxflow:index>`

Once you’ve gone through that, you can proceed :doc:`proceed with installation <getting_started>`
and go through our 5-minutes :doc:`tutorial <tutorial>`.

Leveraging the speed and potential of multi-GPU models was never easier with our
:doc:`multi-GPU base model <multi_gpu>`.
