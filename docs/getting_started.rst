Before we can dive in, make sure **cxflow-tensorflow** is installed properly.


Installation
************

The simplest way of installing **cxflow-tensorflow** – and our recommendation for most of cxflow’s
users - is using ``pip``.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cxflow-tensorflow

Alternatively, **cxflow-tensorflow** can be installed directly from the sources.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/Cognexa/cxflow-tensorflow.git

Developer Installation
**********************

Finally, cxflow might be installed directly for development purposes.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:Cognexa/cxflow-tensorflow.git
    cd cxflow-tensorflow
    pip install -e .
