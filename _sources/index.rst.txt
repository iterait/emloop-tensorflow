Welcome to cxflow-tensorflow docs
=================================

Cxflow-tensorflow is **cxflow** plugin for training TensorFlow models with ease.
It allows you to focus on the model architecture instead of writing the burdensome code around it.

Before you start working with cxflow-tensorflow, make sure you are well aware of

- `TensorFlow essentials <https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/>`_
- :doc:`cxflow basics <cxflow:index>`

After that, :doc:`proceed with installation <getting_started>` and go
through our 5-minutes :doc:`tutorial <tutorial>`.

Leveraging the speed and potential of multi-GPU models was never easier with our
:doc:`multi-GPU base model <multi_gpu>`.
